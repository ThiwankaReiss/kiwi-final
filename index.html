                    fuzzy, and found in the produce section </span> of your local supermarket. But the
                    kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the
                    size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird
                    found only in New Zealand.

                    HABITAT AND DIET
                </h2>
                <p id="para-type-2">
                    The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend
                    to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees
                    found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up
                    into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi
                    / makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy
                    forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows
                    within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest
                    burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at
                    the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the
                    female is ready to lay her eggs.

                    FAMILY LIFE
                </h2>

                        Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other
                        and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do
                        fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she
                        is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi
                        invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis
                        have been known to fight to the death, although this is
                        rare.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a
                        female may choose a new male if a more desirable one
                        wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or
                        fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one
                        around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested,
                        the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                        Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests
                        might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug
                        by the male.

                        The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs
                        are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color.
                        They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg
                        might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would
                        be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving
                        birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to
                        the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the
                        female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms)
                        rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6
                        kilograms).
